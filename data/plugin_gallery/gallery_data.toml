# Array of slide configurations
###############################

# Each appearance of [[slides]] defines a slide configuration 
# in the slides array.

[[slides]]

# There it was, your first slide configuration, and its empty.
# For the plugin to be satisfied, every slide must have a valid
# path set for either 'href' or 'src'.

# My slide configurations begin like this:
