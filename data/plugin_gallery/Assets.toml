# Array of slide configurations
###############################

# Each appearance of [[Slides]] defines a slide configuration 
# in the slides array.

[[Slides]]

# There it was, your first slide configuration, and its empty.
# For the plugin to be satisfied, every slide must have a valid
# path set for either 'href' or 'src'.
#
# My slide configurations begin like this:
#
# [[Slides]]
# Title = "American Fabric"
# Src = "https://moondeer.blog/uploads/2021/80b124a294.jpg"

# There are a ridiculous number of parameters you can set
# individually for each slide. Here's a look at 'em:

# 'src' parameter value has been provided.
